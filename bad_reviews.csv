Obrigado Lisboa,felix suidman,1 star,"BIG SCAM AND TOURIST TRAP!!!
Not gonna lie the whole experience was horrible. We were led in to the restaurant thinking it would be nice. Some dude got us into the restaurant (kinda sketchy but at the moment it seemed fine). The food was relatively expensive so we all only got food and no drinks at all. As we sat down some of the waiters tried to have some very weird and awkward conversations with my friends and I, but that was not the biggest issue. The food was horrible. The steaks were salted to an extent that I felt sick afterwards. The risotto was pretty much 60% garlic and overall just kind of dry and disgusting. Definitely not worth the price. Now to the bill. I counted the money for the 6 of us and it ended up being around €120 for us. This price is okay, but when we were brought the bill, he showed us a picture of it on our phone and showed it for about 3 seconds, charging us €200. I have no clue where those extra €80 came from, but definitely not for customer service, as it sucked. We had to pay and could barely do anything to stop it, as they were very fast with it. Also, at the beginning they said that there is wine on the house. We ended up needing to pay for this and the wine literally tasted like grape juice with vodka poured into it. Biggest tourist trap ever and I feel ashamed to have eaten there. Avoid this at all cost. Any other place is worth it way more. Lastly, all the 5 star reviews on this are obviously faked so do not fall for them! Hope this helps anybody that’s new to Lisbon. It’s a great city and people like this ruin it for everyone."
Obrigado Lisboa,Julia Ivanova,5 stars,"We had a  nice evening meal here. Yes the wine was expensive. Before we sat down we were told the wine was 4 euro per glass. They charged us more on the bill. When my partner started to give out, they kindly gave us more wine. Then we had a good loughter looking at other recent reviews. The lady waitress was very nice and patient."
Obrigado Lisboa,Rick Sleaze,5 stars,"**Restaurant Review: A Quirky Steakhouse Experience**

Nestled in the heart of the city, this steakhouse promises a dining experience that's both unique and memorable. My recent visit there was a rollercoaster of flavors, atmosphere, and service that I won't soon forget.

**Food:**
The star of the menu is undoubtedly the thin steak. Cooked to perfection, it had a delightful balance of tenderness and charred edges that offered a satisfying bite. While some might prefer a thicker cut, the thin steak here allows for a perfect sear, locking in juices and flavor. Accompanied by a side of crisp, golden fries, the dish was a testament to simplicity done right.

**Drinks:**
The beer selection is extensive, but what truly stands out is the ""large beer"" option. Served in a tankard that feels like it was designed for a giant, this drink is both impressive and refreshing. The cold, frothy brew pairs wonderfully with the steak, enhancing the overall dining experience. Whether you're a fan of lagers, ales, or stouts, there's a large beer to suit every palate.

**Service:**
The wait staff here are a charmingly aggressive bunch, adding a layer of quirky enjoyment to the meal. Their approach is direct and energetic, making sure that every need is met with brisk efficiency. Some may find their style a bit brash, but it's all part of the establishment's unique charm. They keep the atmosphere lively, ensuring that there's never a dull moment.

**Ambiance:**
The ambiance is a blend of rustic and modern, with wooden tables and exposed brick walls complemented by contemporary lighting. It's a cozy yet vibrant setting that makes you feel right at home while also keeping the energy levels high.

In summary, this steakhouse offers a distinctive dining experience with its expertly prepared thin steak, generously sized beers, and a wait staff that's both entertaining and efficient. If you're looking for a place with personality and great food, this is definitely worth a visit."
Obrigado Lisboa,Marius Bubnelis,1 star,That man is money stealer. Guest dish later ir calculating in total bill. They show on menu dishes for 17eur. And pricing the different value later. 18 eur the chamge he put in the pocket without asking as a tips. The wors place to eat in Lisbon
Obrigado Lisboa,As aventuras do Garfield,1 star,"Realmente os comentários anteriores sao verdadeiros,o cardapio apresentado na rua tem valores inferiores ao que pagamos depois de pedir a conta. Pagei 30€ por quase nada, estava bom e verdade. Infelizmente e a roubalheira ao turismo"
Obrigado Lisboa,Sônia Prado,3 stars,"Trata-se de hospedagem Hostel. Lugar bem simples, acomodações sem conforto. Ambiente limpo. Espaço para pequenas refeições. Toalhas de banho limpas, porém pequenas e mto finas."
Obrigado Lisboa,Humberto Marsiglia,1 star,Pior que a comida é o roubo descarado e a malandragem…o que parece ser a regra nesta rua.
Obrigado Lisboa,Jamie Rochford,1 star,"7.50 Euro for a house glass of wine. Brutal. How is that possible. The waiter gave me garage reasoning. They don't have the glass of wine price only bottles but that's unheard of here. And when they gave us the ""bill"" he was just giving random numbers and adding the total incorrectly. Then went on about how we can add what we want for tip because it's optional in Portugal. He repeated it twice.

The food was very average but way over priced. It wasn't my choice to go to and didn't want to go after my simple experience of walking by numerous times.

Hopefully others read this and stay away. I think they just try to scam people there."
Obrigado Lisboa,Lance Thurston,4 stars,"A very enjoyable, relaxed meal. Server very attentive and most willingly helpful in translating to English. Food was top notch."
Obrigado Lisboa,Di Su,1 star,Don’t go!!!!! We were led by the staff into the restaurant. The worst experience ever. The food was disgusting. When we raised the issue they didn’t give a damn care. The soup we ordered was probably made with instant soup satchel. The staff tricked us and didn’t even allow us to pay by card.
Obrigado Lisboa,Subash Gogia,1 star,"We were living in an apartment right next door so decided to have lunch there. they started off being very friendly. we ordered some stuff like paella which was 22 euro for a seafood paella for 2 people. then we asked him to recommend a vegetarian dish as the menu didn't have much.  he sold us a rice with peas, carrots and onions for two people. our mistake was not to confirm the price as it was off the menu and a simple dish.  they charged us 60 euros for this. It was the most shocking experience for us. and when we confronted them that they tricked us they denied it and said that was the price. We felt quite sure it was a deliberate trap. when I came to review them I read so many similar reviews from others that I realised we were right to feel tricked. I am amazed they are still in business."
Obrigado Lisboa,TinTin Jones Scheutz,1 star,"A total scam! Don’t go here.
The food was good but they tried to cheat me on the bill, plus EUR 13 for service!
Didn’t even want to show the receipt.
WARNING!!!"
Obrigado Lisboa,Marko Vauda,1 star,"Never go here, disgusting food, annoying staff, extraordinarily expensive. They changed their name to Heaven's door, probably because they're scamming people. 5€ serving fee, no invoice. Go to McDonald's if you want a better experience. I hope some government agency actually shuts this place down, this can't be legal. Please people of Lisboa, report this place because it's actually hurting Lisboas tourism."
Obrigado Lisboa,Mike Kulasinski,1 star,This is a real tourist trap. Do not go there. We had disgusting fish there and overpriced paella. Not even mentioning how expensive the bread cheese and ham is which they bring to your table for start (around 20 EUR)
Obrigado Lisboa,Kristoffer Tedenmark,1 star,"Could not pay by card, prices on menu where almost half of what it actually cost, which you of course didn't find out until the bill came. Worst place I've eaten in years"
Obrigado Lisboa,Camilla Dutra,1 star,"Uma péssima experiência pra nós (eu e meu marido) que tínhamos acabado de chegar em Lisboa. Pedimos uma sugestão da casa, nao estava no cardápio. Foi um prato com frutos do mar, sendo eles: sardinha, camarão, marisco e outras especiarias do local. Na hora do pagamento levamos um susto enorme! 188€ um absurdo! Nem no restaurante mais antigo do mundo (em Madrid) pagamos isso, isso que comemos 3 refeições + 2 garrafas de vinho é uma sobremesa (gastamos 134€).
Ficamos muito surpresos e assustados. Sorte que tínhamos para pagar e saímos se dizer nada pois estávamos turistando. Minha cunhada é cidadã Portuguesa e nós informou sobre o ""caderno de reclamação"" mas já era tarde. Resumo da história: depois desse susto, saímos de Lisboa e voltamos para Braga antes do previsto e não tivemos vontade de conhecer a cidade."
Obrigado Lisboa,Happyguest London,1 star,"With the number of 1-star reviews on here, it's a miracle that this place still exists. They brought out 2 disgusting salad dishes that we didn't order, and later charged €9 each. The vegetables look like they've been left in the heat for several days. We ordered a grilled fish dish and they brought a dish with 4 fish. However they later said the price shown in the menu is PER FISH. So a fish dish costed €56! It's the worst tourist trap in the city!! Avoid at all cost."
Obrigado Lisboa,Connor Dood,1 star,"DO NOT GO HERE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

I have never felt more cheated. We were originally planning on going to the restaurant next door since our hotel recommended it. Unfortunately, it was closed when we got there, so the staff here roped us into sitting down at their restaurant. I normally check reviews before eating anywhere (especially in touristy areas of Europe), but since our original plans didn’t work out, we just wanted to sit down somewhere and eat... boy oh boy do I wish I would’ve read the reviews on here!

Everything started out very pleasant. We ordered drinks and a meat platter for 2 that the waiter recommended. Thankfully (especially after reading reviews here) I had the foresight to confirm the price with the waiter, which was 40 euros. OK. Had I not confirmed the price, I’m sure they would’ve charged much, much more based on all these reviews. After ordering, they came around with the notorious “starters” — 2 dry rolls, a few slices of cheese, and a couple slices of meat. When the waiter dropped this off, we asked what they were. He said that they were “starters.” And we said, “so are they free?” And he said, “yes they’re starters.” And we said, “so no charge?” And said said, “yes” and walked away.

The food was not good. The meat was over cooked and dry, the salad was just lettuce, and the French fries were probably the best part. When we got our bill, we saw that they charged 17 euros for the “starter” ... a total rip off. We asked about it, and the waiter lied about having told us they were free and said “oh, that’s just what we do here in Portugal.”

We figured it was a waste of time to try and argue more, so we got out our credit card to pay ... and guess what? “Sorry sir, our credit card machine is not working.” (Cash only business... hmmm... maybe their customers aren’t the only ones they’re frauding.) This was a problem for us since we were leaving the next day and only had enough euros left for a taxi back to the airport. We argued a little more and explained that with a restaurant with these kinds of prices in a touristy area, they need to notify customers in advance if they don’t accept credit cards because lots of people don’t carry that much money in euros. We asked if they would take American dollars (since that’s all we had), and they refused. They pointed us in the direction of an ATM, but we explained that we only had a credit card and American dollars and no way to withdraw money from an ATM. They shrugged and insisted that it wasn’t their fault. Luckily, I dug through my wallet and found an ATM card that I completely forgot I had with me, so one of the waiters took me to the ATM and waited as I withdrew money. No clue how much the transaction fee will end up being for withdrawing euros from a random ATM... but that seemed to be the only option.

Our bill was 66 euros, so I withdrew 70 euros from the ATM. We ended up finding 6 euros in coins, so we could pay the exact amount. (Sorry guys, no tip today ... you can take the 95% margin on your meat and cheese as your tip). As we were walking away, I realized that in the hectic-ness of everything, I accidentally gave the waiter 76 euros instead of 66. SO, I went back and told them I needed my 10 euro bill back. The main guy argued with me for a while until I found the guy I gave the money to, who also insisted I only gave him 66. I told him to pull all the money out of his pockets (since that’s where he had put it when I paid him) and ... surprise, surprise, 76 euros. I took my 10 euro bill back even though the main waiter continued to object. On our way out, I casually mentioned to the only other couple in the restaurant that had just sat down that this restaurant does not accept credit cards. When the main waiter heard me talk to them, he started yelling loudly at me as I walked away.

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. This place should not be allowed to remain in business. I wish I could give this place a negative number of stars."
Obrigado Lisboa,50mousey,1 star,"Total scam!!!!!!! Stay out!!

This place doesn't even deserve a one star!!  First of all, they bring cheese, meats and bread to the table - we never asked for it.  We knew not to eat it, that we would be charged.  However, they found another way to rip us off - we ordered a fish dish - which was probably the worst fish we had since we arrived in Portugal a week ago.  We could have lived with that - but the bill was ridiculous.  They charged each thing on the plate separately, ie French fries 3.40eu, salad 5 euro, water, 4 euro, you get the picture.  They apparently don't take charge cards...hmmmmmm we should never have allowed them to rip us off. To add insult - the waiter had the audacity to tell us the 10 percent tip was not included in the price.!!  DO NOT go to  this restaurant."
Obrigado Lisboa,Angélica María Pardo López,1 star,"THIEVES. Dont go there. They are taking advantage of tourists because they know they will never come back. We made a small research and noticed that there are five restaurants in the area that belong to the same person. The chain is called ""Portugal no Prato"" and they have more than one ""Obrigado Lisboa"" so take care.

They charged us some starters that we didn't ask for (bread, butter -they charged butter!-and some cheese slices). They didn't give us receipt but showed it in a cellphone and the price was exaggerated. And the waiter told us twice that the tip wasn't included, like pushing us to give it. Very unkind.

The bathroom was broken. There was no way to lock it and the thing to flush didn't exist. You better don't go there, it's a shame to waste the money like this."
Obrigado Lisboa,Baljinder Sandhu,1 star,"DO NOT GO HERE. Wouldn't even rate this restaurant 1 star. Awful food served by crooks. They brought bread, ham and cheese even when we did not order this and had the audacity to charge 14 EUR for this - we didn't even eat these. With our mains, they brought additional sides that we hadn't ordered which totalled another 10 EUR. A small jug of sangria, 25 EUR. When given the bill we were shocked and argued but being in a foreign country, we had no choice but to pay. When paying, the server suggested his credit card machine was down (even though we confirmed they accept card prior to sitting). When we told them we had no cash, they suggested we withdraw cash from a bank machine and come back. After we told them we wouldn't do this, magically the card machine began working again. Going to this restaurant was without a doubt the worst dining experience we've ever had over our countless European holidays."
Obrigado Lisboa,Vadim Gouida,3 stars,We were told that credit card is accepted but it ended up with the show demonstrating that there is no Internet connection. They let us to go to ATM with a trust that we will be back. Service fees were not in the bill but were bluntly required - 10%. The food was good.
Obrigado Lisboa,Miodrag Stoilkovic,1 star,"Worst experience ever. We first got starters and water we did not order, but were told that we do not have to pay if we do not eat it... Then we got cold uncooked food. The waiter even tried to tell me how potatoes are in fact roasted when they were actually cooked, then that vegetables were really grilled when they were just raw sliced all over the ""fish"" plate to mask horrible look of the food. The fish looked just as it tasted. After a few bytes we asked for a check as there was no way we were eating what was served. Then another shock - they asked for 70 eur for the main dish, and tried to bill us twice the wine we ordered. At this point I got upset and starte shouting at the ""manager"". In the end we agreed to pay half the main course and the wine we ordeted, both of which we barelly touched. Lesson learned, check reviews first. Worst hole ever...avoid at all cost."
Obrigado Lisboa,Jack Burrell,1 star,"Appalling experience - Total scam.

We got dragged in here with a party of 13 as we were starving, waiter kept pushing the 2 person sharing platter, when asked how much it was he said he would have to check and it was 'not much'
8 of the group opted for the platters which turned out to cost 100 euro each, on questioning the price the waiter brings out a menu where it is buried on the last page.

The rest of us who did choose from the menu picked dishes in the 10-15 euro range, but honestly the food was some of the worst I've had in Portugal regardless of price.

A total rip off which detracted from the whole trip"
Obrigado Lisboa,Rody Rodman,1 star,"Um ex-carteirista referenciado pela PSP, conhecido como Xula, e um sócio montaram um esquema num conjunto de restaurantes na zona histórica de Lisboa, no qual chegam a cobrar 250 euros por um prato, e espalharam um clima de intimidação nos negócios à volta desses estabelecimentos.

Pelo menos três restaurantes no centro de Lisboa — Made in Correeiros; Obrigado Lisboa e Tiagu’s — praticam o mesmo esquema: os clientes são aliciados na rua por funcionários que mostram uma parte do menu com preços acessíveis. Já sentados, são-lhes sugeridos outros pratos, sem que os clientes vejam o seu preço. Quando vem a conta, os clientes deparam-se com mistas de marisco para dois a 250€, parrilhada de carne a 175€ e outros valores na ordem dos três dígitos. Quando se queixam da conta, é-lhes apresentada a ementa onde constam de facto esses pratos a esses preços."

Obrigado Lisboa,Eunjeong Heo,1 star,"This place is very terrible. Pizza is very hard and there is a hair in my dish.
They did not apologize to us.
We didn't eat pizza, but the bill for food was charged.

We feel they are ignoring it. It's the worst dinner.

Obrigado Lisboa,Scott McMillan,1 star,"Can you leave a zero star review? I feel very fortunate to have gotten out of this place as easy as I did after reading others on here.

My wife and I had an hour to kill before a tour started and we happened to be on this street. So we decided to get a drink. We sat down and ordered. I got a beer, my wife got a sangria. This was our 7th day in Portugal, and 2nd in Lisbon. We kind of knew what the going rate was for these drinks.

I got the bill and it was 14 euros. We had been having drinks like this for around 6 Euros. Assuming they charge more because it's in a high traffic tourist area, it still should have been under 10 Euros.

I was shocked, but not being confrontational (and given the small amount) I paid the bill and left.

I came on here and started reading some of the reviews of this place and a couple other places on this street, so I decided to go back today and see what the price was on the menu.

I walked up the street like my wife and I were interested in sitting down. The big schtick starts with the friendly greeting. I ask to see the drink menu. The beer I paid 5 euros for the day before is on the menu for 3. There is no sangria on the menu. I ask and he tells me that the sangria is 5. So instead of 14 euros, I should have paid 8.

I said to the guy (who had been working the day before) ""I paid a lot more than that yesterday"" and handed him the menu. He didn't say anything. He walked back inside. He didn't try to deny it, he didn't have a story. Nothing.

There's a reason their credit card machine doesn't work."
Obrigado Lisboa,Roger F,1 star,"The service was ok, but they offer you ham and cheese and then they charge you 15 €.

I don't recommend this restaurant."

Obrigado Lisboa,tajine and thedine,1 star,"NEW RESTAURANT NAME:

RESTAURANTE OBRIGADO LISBOA.

(They changed their name because they are thiefs and want to continue stealing from kind tourists!)

DO NOT EAT HERE! DONT BE NAIVE; JUST DONT GO!

They have a good talk and I thought they were really kind!! Don't fall for that because you will regret it.

As a solo traveller I felt really betrayed when I found out the free bread with ham with cheese was 25 euros! !!!!
SCAM!!!!!!!

And then they say it's Portugese tradition to give free food, ofcourse without making clear that it's NOT free and actually really expensive.

I had the bread, a few pork chops with very bad frites (see the photo album) + 1 glass of red wine  (5€) TOTAL: 41€ EUROS FOR 1 PERSON.  This is ridiculous.

And yes, the food was not good as you can you see on the two photo's I posted in the Google foto album.

Final note for the ""restaurant"":
Good luck with this poor Obrigado bastards!

You picked the wrong one as I already warned a lot of people in Lisboa including my hostel, everyone on Google and if I see people walking towards your place I would stop them. I actually hope your place burns down one of these days, it will really save a lot of money from innocent tourists. :)

From now I move on and hope that people Google this restaurant before eating.
A lesson I definitely learned. You are a true shame to the loving and caring people of Lisbon.

Kind regards and don't feel welcome in Holland.

This restaurant (as well as Made in Correeiros and Tiagu's) is a trap to steal from tourists! They belong to the same owner. They force the clients to pay huge amounts, charging them for prices that are not explicitly showing in the list.

Obrigado Lisboa,ZecfwFC,1 star,"Attention!!! Paß auf!!! 危険!!!
Please DO NOT GO!!! Stay out of this restraint!!! This restraint doesn't even deserve one star:(((

Before writing our experience at this restraint, let me say their food was ok tasting wise, but...

①Our waiter was very pushy trying to recommend us their ""plate"" that they can arrange and pick few seafoods and vegetables, over and over again (at least for 8 times) even though we kept telling him we've already decided what to oder. At this moment, I immediately thought he is clearly trying to control what for us to oder so that he can charge us for more than the food we had already tried to order from him.
②My friends originally wanted to order one of the popular wines from Portugal that was clearly on their menu, but few minutes after we ordered, he came back to us saying they don't have the wine, but have a great white wine he recommends instead... so we decided to take that one... and it ended up being more than twice the price of the wine that my friends initially wanted to order (stupid us, we didn't ask him the price of the white wine beforehand).
③after we asked the waiter for the check, he came back with the check and asked us to put at least an extra 10% of the check as a tip, and then he stayed at our table and gazed at us as we tried to finish collecting all the money from our wallets. When we gave him the check back with money inside, he started counting the money in front of us to make sure he has an amount that he satisfies, and then he just said to us ""good service"" (to himself??) with a smile, and left us...

Overall, the food was ok, but the service was worse than anything I could've imagined. We didn't wanna give him any tip on the top of the price of their food considering not only he was a pushy and nasty waiter, the white wine and their starters (27€ for cheese and ham that they just automatically serve us without telling us their prices as starters before they take orders) were such a ripoff already. All the waiters at the restraint sort of had coercive feeling that stops us from not giving our waiter more than 10% of the check as a tip as he asked us to... I'm not exaggerating but I was a bit scared because of the attitude that all the waiters had in that restraint!!!

We definitely didn't go to this restraint if we had have a chance to read some of the comments that people have written about this restraint, here on google map in the past..."

According to the menu including rice and fries. These were charged extra. Apparently because of a salad that was delivered without being ordered. The beer was charged at 1 euro more. A very cheeky way to get more money. Quality of the food: Meat is mixed in the truest sense. The salad was not fresh. We declined starters. Would have been charged additionally without asking. Conclusion: stay away! Also from the MomaGrill next to it. It's the same team. The fact that they aren't embarrassed by this... unscrupulous.

Don't go there. We ordered the grill plate for 50 euros. They count us 60. Fries and Rice included says the Menu, they count extra. And count a salad that we did not order, but they bring by themselves. Beer they count 1 euro more. The meet was partly hard to eat. The salad was not fresh. Take another restaurant. Beside MomaGrill is the same groop."
Obrigado Lisboa,Elvira C,1 star,"They hook you on the street with a menu that they don't give you later. There were 5 of us, they offered us two large dishes to share, they gave us ""temptations"" that if we ate them we would pay and if we didn't, we wouldn't... Then the bill was on a tablet and the card didn't work...total scam, the two dishes to share they were one for 90 and another for 75 euros. I didn't want to pay 10% of the service, that was all that was missing. Thieves, tricksters and scammers is to say the least, a full-fledged robbery."
Obrigado Lisboa,Valeria Magnante,1 star,"Very bad. Slow, poor and rude service. 125 euros for a very normal fish cooked on the grill or fried, among other things a surprise bill, as we had ordered something else and the waiter advised us to take the ""specialty of the day"", pretending not to understand it takes us 4 portions for two people, without even asking the size. Furthermore, the price was not indicated on the menu (divided by language, probably translated with Google Translate in a shameful way). It only left us with a lot of bitterness, an empty wallet and a bad memory of the Portuguese."
Obrigado Lisboa,Michael Hücking,1 star,"Tourist trap warning, don't eat there. Charge incredibly expensive service fee, food rather meager. Attract you to the restaurant with a different menu and different prices. It's best to just keep your hands off it."
Obrigado Lisboa,robin oberto,1 star,"Without a doubt the worst place to eat, they hook you but the truth is that the food was quite bad, we went there because it was one of the few places that made Frenchiña and it turned out to be almost pure bread in a flavorless broth, and some with guacamole that were just Doritos with a small piece of chopped avocado, and when we paid the original bill it was almost €30 and they wanted to take €40 from us with things that we don't even know where they charged them from, they want to bill by stealing from the few people who eat there"
Obrigado Lisboa,H. Neumann,1 star,"We were in the restaurant on December 31st, 2016, a big colored waiter immediately besieged us and talked us into this fish platter for two people. Without a map and without mentioning a price. In the picture you can see the result, €295!!!!! for a small half lopster. No boss to speak of, obviously all 5 waiters were in cahoots. I reported the fraud to the police.
Conclusion: Avoid this restaurant, it is full of scammers. I wasn't the first, as the police officer confirmed, and unfortunately not the last Turi victim either.
A shame for Lisbon!"
Obrigado Lisboa,Hilbert Annen,1 star,"If we could have a cup of coffee or tea there. Naturally! It took a long time to be served. The coffee was fine, but strange tea. (Herbal tea?) Then the payment. No, that was not possible with the bank card, but only in cash. Price €10. That is an absurd price. This is one of those tents where you have to agree on a price in advance. These are scammers. I told them that too and they haven't blinked an eye. Stay away from here, don't trust coming here."
Obrigado Lisboa,Christina Nissen,1 star,"Rip off! The food is substandard and the service is poor. We were told that bread and cheese only have to be paid for when eaten (they are put on the table as a starter), but that you should pay €14 for 2 wobbly breads and a piece of cheese is more than audacious. A €5 “service fee” will be added to the bill. In addition, the card reader happened to be broken today, so only cash is accepted. I can only agree with the previous speakers: avoid this “restaurant” at all costs!"
Obrigado Lisboa,Manu Sánchez,1 star,"The worst place I have eaten in Portugal... A tourist trap that, from what I see here, changes the name of the awning so that the reviews do not associate it with the name (but come on, the modus operandi is the same).
The Sapateira, with ketchup...
The very dry roasted cod...
€17 for 6 bad garlic prawns...
They try to offer things that they don't have on the menu to impress you (€60 for a cod dish).
A little gem, come on... avoid it as much as possible!"
Obrigado Lisboa,Carlos De Santos Manso,1 star,"Don't go, the owner is a jerk. 1 hour for two sandwiches, and a cod. They try to sell what he wants and not what you ask for. I wanted to sell a Coca-Cola zero as caffeine-free. He charges a service of €5 just for the sake of it, asking you to remove the bread. It is best that no one goes, unpleasant experience and not recommended. Don't let the commercial with grandpa fool you."
Obrigado Lisboa,김성빈,1 star,"It's a bad thing. Since it was a restaurant under the hostel, I went there without thinking, but I regretted going after seeing the Google rating... It wasn't told in advance that cards weren't accepted, and when I ordered food, they informed me that they only accept cards. The food is not tasty either. 10. It is definitely not the quality you would buy for a few euros. I couldn't hear anything cooking in the kitchen, and it seemed like they were serving food on some kind of timer. Anyway, don't be fooled by the touts and just look at the Google rating once.. Please don't go ㅜㅜㅜㅠ"
Obrigado Lisboa,Mario Cepeda Ávila,1 star,"The worst restaurant I have ever eaten in my life… at least my dish was good. Defrosted squid and you cannot pay by card supposedly because it is restricted after hours, all lies. Manual tourist"
Obrigado Lisboa,José Escriche Asensio,5 stars,"Despite the reviews we had dinner there, and the experience was good. The food was very abundant, and it was delicious. They charged us what we asked for, with no additional charges. The only bad thing was that the water seemed a bit expensive to us."
Obrigado Lisboa,José Miguel Fernández Linde,1 star,"AWFUL. A complete scam, they trick you and take you away promising you a whole culinary experience, the food is disastrous and the worst thing is when it comes time to check, they give them to you everywhere, it also occurred to me to order 2 gyn-tonics, €20 each one, then they come to you saying that the dataphone is broken and when you ask them for the ticket they quickly show you a tablet on which you don't see anything, cleanliness is also conspicuous by its absence, if you are a tourist...... DON'T GET Caught"
Obrigado Lisboa,Alessandro Di Benedetto,1 star,"""Attention! Licensed scammers""
—
This review is mainly to save tourists from a place designed to systematically fleece customers.

We asked for a mixed grill of meat for €20.00 for 2, 1 roast chicken for €10.00 and an omelette for €8.00 with 3 beers and a water: bill €154.00. Obviously I was shown the real price of what was served to us only at the time of the bill.

The cards don't work. The receipt was presented to me but was not released to me after receiving the cash.

Arrogant and opinionated attitude in front of the obvious complaint of poor quality (the meat was reheated and not cooked at the moment).

The only positive note was the fast service, soon confirmed by the evident desire to close (for the record we arrived at 10pm and left at 11pm)

Places like these unfortunately greatly downgrade Portuguese cuisine and the desire to invest in tourism in this beautiful nation."
Obrigado Lisboa,Kevin Poupard,1 star,"To avoid !!! They attract people by offering free Port and a menu at an attractive price but it is nothing of the sort. The vegetables are extra and very expensive, the drinks are very expensive too and the food is bad."
Obrigado Lisboa,Fernando Mazo,1 star,"As they say, horrible. We have not been able to eat the cod. They also tried to lose the invoice. By the way, the cod €120."
Obrigado Lisboa,Lele *,1 star,"A star is a sensational gift! AVOID!!
Highly poor and perhaps old food.....arrogance and ugly faces from all the managers.....but the top is the bill!! 50 euros for grilled cuttlefish (plastic consistency), passable salmon, small beer, water. They charged us 10 euros for a small plate of raw ham appetizer which was ridiculous!! I think 30 grams.... maybe.
SCANDALOUS!!"
Obrigado Lisboa,-tolis 34,1 star,"One star is too much for this club where saying they are scammers is a compliment.
After traveling through half of Portugal and enjoying its gastronomy, we had the misfortune to end up in this cold place where the manager serves us with his coat buttoned up to the neck with zero professionalism and asking us to return to Spain after complaining about a bill of €105. for eating poorly, a couple and a 7-year-old child. Dirty place. Colder than on the street. Bad food. Tough and bad tasting meat. Sangria made from Powders at €20.
My son's raw burger cost €15. And on top of that, they ask us, in front of the rest of the tourists (few) there were, to return to Spain as if we were thieves."
Obrigado Lisboa,Amanda Denis,1 star,"Do not go to this restaurant! They are scammers! We wanted to order a bottle of wine but the waiter told us they didn't have a menu. So we took a bottle at random (which we had already bought in stores so we knew by name), this one was charged €45 even though it was a bottle that cost €5 maximum! When we said that this was unacceptable they finally showed us a wine list (which they supposedly didn't have at first) telling us that the prices are not correct! We ended up with an exorbitant bill because of their dishonesty!
TO FLEE !"
Obrigado Lisboa,Iris B.,1 star,"Never! Criminal! Completely overpriced!

There were five of us looking
a place where we just have a drink
Unfortunately we wanted to be approached and “moved” to a restaurant further away. At the
When we ordered, we said again that we didn't want to eat anything and received it
then no map to be seen. We were then immediately asked what drink we wanted. So without looking at the menu we decided on 2 glasses of sangria (0.3 l), 1 beer and 2 x cola. Later we spontaneously ordered tapas (some cheese, ham and toasted bread).
We were very shocked by the bill that was presented to us on a cell phone screen: €75.60!!!!
The glass of sangria alone cost 9.70!
I asked if they had accidentally charged carafes, but no! I was shown a card with exactly these prices, which I had never seen before. The coke cost €4.50 (can and glass), the beer cost €6.00 and the rest was the tapas, although there was still plastic between the ham. My mistake for not asking for the menu first but the store looked rather ordinary. Such prices were not to be expected.
They justified the high prices by saying that we were in Lisbon because it would be so expensive in the old town. A nasty scam and tourist rip-off!
Just don't go there!!! They have us
messed up the whole evening.
There was also trouble at the next table. The guest should pay for the starters
he didn't order and where he specifically asked, it was said that it was on the house. There were long and loud discussions and the guest
asked the “manager” to calmly call the police. Only then was he allowed to leave. He only paid for what he ordered and that was quite a lot.
We also saw other people being ushered into the restaurant and getting up after looking at the menu. That made us suspicious, but unfortunately we had already ordered.
For me they are criminals!
Bills on mobile phones are also possible
past the tax office!"
Obrigado Lisboa,ismahene benahmed,2 stars,"This restaurant is a tourist trap, the waiter automatically gives you bread, olives, butter... Without telling you that it costs money. Apart from the salmon which was good, the squid was not fresh, the shrimp were tasteless, the salad had no vinaigrette and the bill with supplements that came from who knows where! If possible avoid!"
Obrigado Lisboa,Michael Garvey,1 star,"I've never had such a bad dinner in my life.
The waiters are a group of bandits who - mostly German - want to rip off tourists.
I wish I had taken pictures of the food to expose this place even more, but a few words should suffice.
They offer you a 3-course meal for €17.50, which isn't even on the error-strewn menu. You are served a ridiculous salad that looks like it was taken straight from a McDonalds burger and the ""main course"" is cold, dry and cheap meat that is industrially processed.
We didn't even want to try the dessert because we didn't want to increase our chances of food poisoning any further.
As if that wasn't enough, when the bill came, the very dubious-looking waiter also explained to us that we had to pay 10% on top, which he quickly rounded up to a flat amount and made a very serious, almost threatening face.
I would advise any unsuspecting tourist not to venture into this alley alone because anyone who does can be accosted and kidnapped by this criminal gang.
Beware of Obrigado Lisboa!"
Obrigado Lisboa,Patrice Girardin,2 stars,"Arriving in Lisbon, with friends, late, we were stuck in the street to choose a restaurant. All having more amazing deals than competitors. Our choice fell on this estaminet. While the food isn't bad, the service wasn't great. The vegetables were cold and the price of the wines increased to capture the attractive offers from the tout...In short, even if we paid the advertised price, it was not in the best conditions. You can find much better restaurants if you look around..."
Obrigado Lisboa,Alejandro Berrío Ospina,1 star,"Rubbish place, DO NOT GO!

Obrigado Lisboa,Maddi Astigarraga,1 star,"Regrettable. They don't even deserve a star. They offered us dishes that weren't even on the menu saying they were very good. Both meat, fish and vegetables, almost inedible. They DO NOT allow you to pay by card so one of us had to go to the ATM. He showed us the amount to pay on his cell phone and we had to ask him for the ticket. Don't even think about going."
Obrigado Lisboa,José A. Fidalgo,1 star,"tourist trap
We arrived late and the child was in a hurry to eat,
They approached us in the middle of the street and offered us a menu in Spanish. We didn't look any further (very bad), terrible food, bordering on the poor condition of the products and on top of that, very expensive.
Unfortunately, it's a shame that because they are so well located in the center, they will continue to operate, because if it were for their food..."
Obrigado Lisboa,Berta Sangerman,1 star,"Score = 0
Large-scale scammers, cod on the menu 16 euros, there are 4 different dishes, cod to share for 2 off the menu 120€, ham and cheese 15 and 12 euros without ordering and Coca-Cola and green wine.

Total invoice €169

And on top of that they wanted to keep 10% for the service."
Obrigado Lisboa,Beatriz R.,1 star,"They are scammers. They ruined our day. They served us later than others who came in later. They didn't take the soup on the menu because they said we hadn't ordered it, the fries were cold and they only charged in cash. In addition, the treatment was very bad. One star is a lot. Thank goodness the rest of Lisbon residents are good people."
Obrigado Lisboa,flavie dan,1 star,"Be careful, scam, address not recommended because it is overpriced. The waiter speaks your language very well and gives you confidence by offering you a free aperitif… Fish pariahs €140 for two! A hefty bill of €235

Obrigado Lisboa,Maxime VENET,1 star,"BEWARE SCAM!! Tourist trap
Called by a tout in the middle of the street, we simply wanted to have a drink with some tapas.

Obrigado Lisboa,Joaquin Darder,1 star,"What a tough face they have.
I doubt the business is the restaurant.
An inedible salad, when asking to remove it. They change it for one just as bad. The very expensive wine (€20 for a discount white wine) cost €3."
Obrigado Lisboa,Israel Japón Vázquez,1 star,"!!PLEASE READ IT! We have been there and it is truly unfortunate. The food is disgusting and to make matters worse they offer us a plate of boneless ham saying that it is very good and that we should try it without any problem. In the end they charged us 10 euros for the plate of ham that we didn't even order, disgusting and salty. To make matters worse, at the end it came to us with a bill for the food on a mobile phone and without any bill and on top of that we had to pay a 10% extra service fee without specifying it anywhere. Please don't go and get ripped off like we were. It would be appreciated if they would close the bar to people like that, who only think about scamming and deceiving people."
Obrigado Lisboa,Mathieu Naour,1 star,"Thieves. The dish is served without vegetables. So the vegetables are extra at 3.80 on average per plate, i.e. a plate of fries, a plate of potatoes, a plate of rice, a plate of vegetables plus 2 salads at 5 euros per plate. €74.60 for a steak and 2 sea bream and 3 beers. It's more expensive than in Paris for the same type of dish. The sea bream and entrecote dishes are good but for the surprise of the bill and the thief's way of doing things and I don't recommend this thief.
To flee"
Obrigado Lisboa,ARANTES CYBELE,1 star,"This restaurant is a trap for simpletons. A scam for tourists, very expensive dishes for Portugal and this style of restaurant, each accompaniment is chargeable And expensive. For example, a bottle of Mateus rosé wine sold for 2.49 euros is charged 25.00 euros. As soon as I expressed my opinion, the guy offered a port which was undiluted pastis. The waiter acted innocent but he was dishonest and agreed to offer parilladas at an exorbitant price apart from the fact that it was sûil s It's a Spanish dish in a restaurant claiming to be Portuguese. AVOID...,,"
Obrigado Lisboa,Raquel Sanz Revilla,1 star,"Real scam, I don't know how the Portuguese police can't do anything against them. They give you a price and then charge you whatever they want.

Obrigado Lisboa,Rafael López,1 star,"!!Tourist trap!! They are professional scammers. They charged our account for things that we had not ordered (starters that we had not ordered and did not touch) and they wanted to charge us 10 percent more for table services, already outside the account.

Obrigado Lisboa,Peter Schieber,4 stars,Excellent food and wine at very reasonable prices. Service OK. Only the kitchen seemed a bit inattentive. Soup was ordered three times by the waiter before it was handed out by the kitchen.

Obrigado Lisboa,Yoli R,1 star,Truly unfortunate. Some really bad scammers. Reading the pathetic comments I completely agree with each of them.

Heaven's Door,felix suidman,1 star,"BIG SCAM AND TOURIST TRAP!!!
Before I post this below, I posted the same review on the restaurant right next to it called Obrigado because they are the same restaurant. Their horrible reviews have made them try to change their name and add it as another location to try to get better ones. This is the first sign of how much of a scam this place is. Now to continue, here is the rest because this was quite something. Not gonna lie the whole experience was horrible. We were led in to the restaurant thinking it would be nice. Some dude got us into the restaurant (kinda sketchy but at the moment it seemed fine). The food was relatively expensive so we all only got food and no drinks at all. As we sat down some of the waiters tried to have some very weird and awkward conversations with my friends and I, but that was not the biggest issue. The food was horrible. The steaks were salted to an extent that I felt sick afterwards. The risotto was pretty much 60% garlic and overall just kind of dry and disgusting. Definitely not worth the price. Now to the bill. I counted the money for the 6 of us and it ended up being around €120 for us. This price is okay, but when we were brought the bill, he showed us a picture of it on our phone and showed it for about 3 seconds, charging us €200. I have no clue where those extra €80 came from, but definitely not for customer service, as it sucked. We had to pay and could barely do anything to stop it, as they were very fast with it. Also, at the beginning they said that there is wine on the house. We ended up needing to pay for this and the wine literally tasted like grape juice with vodka poured into it. Biggest tourist trap ever and I feel ashamed to have eaten there. Avoid this at all cost. Any other place is worth it way more. Lastly, all the 5 star reviews on this are obviously faked so do not fall for them! Hope this helps anybody that’s new to Lisbon. It’s a great city and people like this ruin it for everyone."

Heaven's Door,José silva,1 star,"Neste restaurante encontram-se inúmeras opções, contudo falta sabor nos pratos.
Existe uma enorme falta de honestidade por parte dos empregados de mesa.
Foi nos faturados a mais 10% do que deveria ter sido, supostamente por causa de um menu que não foi pedido/apresentado.
Para além disso o terminal de multibanco não funciona (supostamente), fazendo com que tivesse de levantar dinheiro para puder pagar a refeição.
Quando ao ambiente, o restaurante deixa muito a desejar, principalmente devido á música alta e verdadeiramente horrível, pela falta de educação e pela linguagem fútil apresentada, indevida para um restaurante deste tipo.
É uma verdadeira armadilha para os turistas.
Gostaria mesmo de puder dar 0 estrelas, mas como não é possível sou obrigado a dar pelo menos 1.
Não recomendo."
Heaven's Door,John Mathew,1 star,"Fraudsters and scam artists. They will overcharge you and will not give you bills as their computer system will be always down. The total amount will be shown to you on a phone screen and even on that screen there is no itemised bill. Too many guys will be  standing out on the main street to catch you. Run away.!!! There are other genuine restaurants nearby. Credit card payments, using a mobile app, are limited to an amount of 100 euros. I have no idea how safe it is. A perfect scam by a fraudulent racket. Please read all the reviews below.  The owner and his wife has written some good reviews and the rest, the real guests have written the truth."
Heaven's Door,Samantha Heinrich,5 stars,"This restaurant is definitely a must try. Usually I avoid going to touristy places, but the sweet guys convinced me to try their food. And this was by far the most decently priced and generous portion of octopus I’ve had in Portugal so far. Ricardo is also simply one of the sweetest people around. He made everything even more enjoyable.
The store just opened, so I’d love other people to support them!"
Heaven's Door,Ivan Lau,1 star,"The are off the Main Street so have someone standing there and take you to their place. Do not follow them. They are a scam. Ask them to replace potato with rice and salad, they end up bringing both on top of the potato and charge us 8 euro for them. They add 10% service charge on top which they never disclosed. Never have a single restaurant in Portugal add service fees. Beer is expensive. They do not accept credit card at all and do not issue receipts. Likely they get too many disputes and no credit card company would do business with them. What a shame for otherwise a place providing good food."
Heaven's Door,Manas,1 star,"Seduced by sweet talk on the street, forced to spend more than what was worth. The environment felt cheap, as well as the food. Definitely stay away from this place"
Heaven's Door,Laurence Wang,1 star,"This is a scam! avoid this restaurant! A simple lunch costed 30+Euro/Person. The lady bartender said they accept card, and when I was trying pay the bill, I was told card is not acceptable. They allowed me to try the card reader after I insisted and told the waiter that the lady bartender said card is ok. No print out bill, prices are shown  on a phone screen. No paper receipt with itemized price. I believe I was overcharged by 20-30 Euro, Should have check google reviews before stepping into the restaurant. The bad experience in this restaurant ruined my vacation in Lisbon."
Heaven's Door,Natália Šovčíková,1 star,Avoid it at all costs. The waiters appear to be nice but they lie. The price was different from what was meant to be and the food was mostly bad. Wish we checked the place and the reviews before.
Heaven's Door,Cristi Ioanitescu,1 star,"Please, do not go there!!  Shame, what a ripp off!!!  130 euros for 7 bears and 2 cups of white wine (that is not wine). The waiter was trying to convince me that the price was ok, when I told him I have dinned at Rocco’s for 120 euros, 2 pers, main courses, water and 1 bottle of wine.  Just plain stupid and rude to lie to our face. We thought it was a simple tavern, normal prices, but we were wrong."
Heaven's Door,TJ Woodworth,1 star,Tried to charge us for a beer (didn't have one at all) and then two waters when we only had one. Had a table service fee of €3.9. The way they billed was different and now I am concerned about the security of the payment processing. 12 days in Portugal and worst by far. Go elsewhere.
Heaven's Door,Stacey Del Valle,1 star,"Deceitful scam artists. We stumbled upon this while looking for a dinner spot. We ended up going because we had not yet tried Franchesina and were leaving Lisbon the following day. The entire operation was shady. We had red flags when we were the only table that occupied the restaurant. This was further amplified by only receiving a total amount and never receiving a written bill. They offered bread, cheese and ham and ended up charging 45 euros for it. The owner was talking poorly about us in Portuguese as we exited the restaurant. DO NOT go here. I wish we had looked up the reviews before walking in the door."
Heaven's Door,Lisa Boysen,1 star,"Shrimp came with veins, heads and shells and was frozen from china according to the boxes that were delivered after our meal! Octopus was tough and cod was stringy and tough. Horrible food and 1 beer, 1 wine, 1 soup and 2 entrees, $80 euros. Service was very good and attentive. The guy on the street who loured us in promised that the fish was fresh. The Port they gave us tasted like sugar water. So disgusting."
Heaven's Door,Daniel Vinícius,1 star,"Péssimo atendimento. Não recomendaria esse lugar para ninguém. Não aceitavam cartão como pagamento, não avisaram no começo. Atendente foi mal educado. Pedi contribuição na fatura e me foi negada a fatura. Não compactuem com esse restaurante."
Heaven's Door,Daniel Vennske Ziemiński,1 star,"The worst place I ever been to! Cesar salad doesn't taste like cesar, no dresing. It feels like the mafia is working there! They charge you for things ypu did'nt order, so many mestakes on the bill... I definitely don't recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!! ⛔️"
Heaven's Door,Foster,1 star,"This place is a SCAM. Terrible food and they will try to scam you one way of another. Can’t believe the city allows places like this to exist. It gives Lisbon a terrible reputation.
Please do not eat here."
Heaven's Door,Hannah Parks,5 stars,"We had such a great time at Heaven’s Door! The manager, Ricardo, was extremely attentive and energetic. Good vibes all around! The food was served quickly and very tasty. Drinks were 10/10, our glass was never empty! Would certainly recommend."
Heaven's Door,Yichen L.,1 star,Absurdly expensive (a glass wine for more than 10 euros). They don't accept card payment and have only shown price on a phone screen. Plus it is not possible to get receipt. Should have read other reviews before stepping into the restaurant.
Heaven's Door,Christy Price,5 stars,"Delicious codcakes, amazing shrimp and octopus salad, with 2 large Superbock - under 40€, great atmosphere for lunch or dinner."
Heaven's Door,Flavio Garcia Pinheiro,1 star,"Não recomendo e peço para que se atentem aos comentários já postados. O Heaven´s Door e o Moma (que fica ao lado) são o mesmo restaurante. Estive por mais de uma semana hospedado em frente e não só fui vítima, como vi diariamente os golpes aplicados, incluindo com necessidade de intervenção policial. Os principais são: 1- não aceitar cartão (só avisam na hora de pagar a conta); 2- itens superfaturados; 3- cobrança de 10% sobre o serviço (taxa de serviço)."
Heaven's Door,Pauline Brighton,3 stars,"Beware cash only. The meal was good. We had two mains two beers and was asked if we wanted bread and small tastes of   ham/cheese while we waited. We agreed but did not see these on menu that all items were individually priced(at a previous restaurant this cost 6 euro allogether)  when we got the bill it was 100euros. No receipt, the hidden costs were a shock, and it was cash only, which was not displayed ,we only just had enough to pay. There are lots of other nice restaurants around."
Heaven's Door,A G,2 stars,"Honestly, the food is pretty good and our waiter was super friendly, but only at the end of the meal were we shocked to see the bill.
They will bring you bread, olives and ham... felt complimentary, but at the end you will get charged for each of them as well as a tax that needs to be visible on the menu by law which it isn't. Our food price was €38, the bill we received was €78, so beware before going here.
Maybe this is why in the middle of lisbon they only accept cash, so there's no record of your visit."
Heaven's Door,Angela Praill,4 stars,Menu is not cheap. We selected cod cakes and bifana which were good. Not what we would call  Authentic Portuguese food like we've experienced in other cities so far. Just ask questions about your bill and understand that it is typical for restaurants here to bring extras but they are not free.
Heaven's Door,Ronaldo A,1 star,"Uma estrela é muito! Fujam desse lugar! Escape! Comida até razoável, mas depois de comer virem com desculpa que a máquina de cartão está com problema e te forçarem a pagar em dinheiro, é crime! Deveriam ter avisado assim que entramos. Só que não contavam que aqui é Brasil.. Falei que ué não tinha dinheiro e não ia sacar no caixa eletrônico para pagar IOF. Bati o pé e perceberam que não sou idiota e aí, misteriosamente,a máquina volta a funcionar. Turistas, fujam!"
Heaven's Door,Jamie Davidson,1 star,"We had dinner here last night, we had a meal for two and two beers the meal should’ve been €46. They brought out ham, cheese and bread and placed on table and then charged €35 for something we had not ordered. When asked where it was on the menu they showed us the last page and a small sticker with writing all in Portuguese. The food was okay but nothing special. Avoid at all costs"
Heaven's Door,YYY ZZZ,1 star,"Like many other people said, this restaurant is ruining the image of the city by scams. They charge you more with all kinds of hidden bills, like they tell you they can personalize your order with the price on the menu, but when you pay the bill, they tell you this change cost you $$$. I paid 50€ more than I ordered.  Too bad experience.  A good lesson is you must read reviews before you go to a restaurant here."
Heaven's Door,Cáitlin Graham,1 star,"Very poor food, we were so disappointed after thinking that we found an authentic Portuguese restaurant. The owner seems to own the 3 restaurants beside it and he was so angry & aggravated during our meal. Our waiter was okay but the service charge was excessive - for 2 sides, 2 beers & 2 waters we paid nearly €50! We asked for bread & olives which didn't arrive. Overall, this has been our worst culinary experience in Lisbon, which is a shame. It is a tourist trap area but your money is better spent elsewhere!"
Heaven's Door,Maciej Lewinski,1 star,"The worst restaurant in all of Lisbon. Food not tasty and expensive. Additionally, the staff adds 10% to the bill. And of course you won't get a receipt because the cash register is broken. I honestly don't recommend this supposedly restaurant."
Heaven's Door,Mara Oliveira,1 star,"Eles cobram uma taxa de 10% mais um taxa de uns aperitivos que não pedimos os aperitivos saíram por mais caro que o valor da comida uma conta de 40 € saiu por 77€. A comida não é ruim, o rapaz foi muito simpático para atender. Mas, é um assalto as taxas que cobram sem te avisarem. Nunca mais e não recomendo."
Heaven's Door,Helga Groenewald,1 star,I wish we had read reviews!!! We also stumbled across this restaurant today. Absolute scam artists. They charged us 15 errors for a quarter a glass vino verde! When we requested the bill they said their machine was broken and just gave us the amount. They also said they couldn’t accept card payments. The waiter then tried to charge us for sitting outside on the pavement. When we went inside they could only show us the bill on the computer screen. We were so angry and felt that we were being ripped off!!!!!!!!
Heaven's Door,Taz Vaid,1 star,"This place is a scam. They display prices on the menu without starting that they are take away only, the prices for drinking at the table are 50% higher but no way of telling that from the menu. Once you ask for the bill, someone but not your waiter appears with a bill on a phone and magically their card machine doesn't work either. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE THEY PREY ON TOURISTS AND ARE A DISGRACE TO THE CITY."
Heaven's Door,Larissa M,1 star,"Se desse pra dar 0 estrelas eu daria! Golpe atrás de golpe. Eles empurraram couvert de um jeito como se nossa comida fosse demorar horas pra sair e empurraram acompanhamentos que vc acharia que seriam inclusos no prato mas não eram. Ai no fim da conta, trouxeram um print de uma conta no cel e nada impresso alegando que a máquina não está prestando, e só no final avisam que não passa cartão de crédito. A conta que era pra ser 40 euros veio 80! Chocada e decepcionada com o caráter das pessoas que trabalham lá."
Heaven's Door,Artur Biernacki,1 star,"This place is a scam, the waiters are liars. The nearby restaurants are also a scam run by the same people. In addition to the ordered dishes, the waiter served snacks, claiming that they were free of charge. When it came to paying the bill, the waiter told me that the snacks were put on my table for free, but since I had eaten them, I had to pay for them - 50 euros for a few slices of cheap ham, olives and bread. When I said I wouldn't pay for ""free"" snack and wanted to warn other customers that this restaurant was a scam, I was surrounded by 6 waiters from nearby restaurants who insisted that I not talk to other customers."
Heaven's Door,Josefina Pagels,1 star,"Probably the worst place to eat in Lisbon. Being located in the more touristy parts of town, we didn’t expect much but this was straight up embarrassing. We received the wrong food (caprese salad instead of Caesar salad) and then had to wait for ages for new food. When we received the “right” salad it wasn’t even a Caesar salad and it did not come with any dressing (they were still making it when they served to food). They refused to give us any discount and were rude and impolite. Avoid at all costs!"

Heaven's Door,Hossein Alami,1 star,"Scam alert!!! Do not go here. Be aware!

The Good: (our order) Grilled sardines were delicious. The bread and cheese were good.

The Bad: The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. The staff were first class scammers!!! After we asked for the bill, they entered food items we ordered (and some we didn't order) into the register, took photos of the register display on their phone, deleted the items from the register, showed us photos and asked for payment and said we do NOT take credit cards!!!!! Only Cash...no receipt...!!!..Take pictures of the menu items and add up your own orders, else you are likely to get ripped off.

In the end, someone is pocketing the cash and the owner (when not there) is probably getting ripped off!

Don't go there...find better places down the street."
Heaven's Door,Dagmar Anna,1 star,"This place is a scam, would not go here! The food was OK, but they charge you for overpriced bread and cheese that seems complimentary at first, add service costs to your bill, add costs for using the cutlery, ask if you want potatoes and/or salad and charge you extra for it. Also claim their printer does not work, they could not give the bill and you have to pay cash. We ended up with and insanely high bill."
Heaven's Door,Donald Scott,1 star,"Only sat for a bottle of wine, when i asked for a menu the waiter told me there was no menu and the service was all oral, continued to explain how the €25 bottle we had bought should’ve costed €65. Was cheap wine available in supermarkets for less than €15. After we had drank from our glasses the waiter returned to tell us he ‘accidentally’ forgot to mention they were cash only. I agree with other reviews- scam."
Heaven's Door,Aleksander Zmurkiewicz,1 star,"Seriously, i have never ever meet with a scam like this. Awfull. You Enter to „restaurant”, order a food and some drinks, meanwhile waiter brings You some „traditional starters” which is free (theoretically) and served on behalf of owner to each customer. Later on, when its high time to pay a bill, instead of 140e we need to Pay 190e. A „restaurant” doesnt want to issue a receipt for us, only showing some amount of money on tablet. When I made a scandal about it, and said im callin police, then suddenly 8 waiters stand next to us and told Thats better to Pay. Finally when other customer reacted we paid only our bill, without any extras. Next time we will come in 16, so r 8 wont be enough."
Heaven's Door,J Fredlock,1 star,Tourist trap - scamming and cheating waiter! Restaurant only takes cash and doesn’t provide a bill or receipt. I ordered one item and then he said something else was better and brought what he wanted instead of what I ordered. Waiter left the table with the € 55 that I paid then returned to the table and set €40 on the table claiming I didn’t give him enough and demanded more. He also said we had to pay him for serving us.

Heaven's Door,Tarja Stenberg,1 star,"Avoid this place!  It is the worst tourist trap ever. They don’t have all the prices visible on the list and charge for everything. Be aware of cheese and ham brought as a appetizer, if you touch them it will cost you a lot! Also service fee will be added on the bill. I asked for receipt but ’computer was broken’ so I did not get any. I felt badly cheated and dont’t recommend this place to anyone."
Heaven's Door,arthur ngt,1 star,"DON’T GO THERE!

We didn’t have the choice to pay 65€ for two poor pasta dishes that were supposed two cost only 15€, a beer and an ice tea and told us that it was because of the « table service » and what was it ? Cheese and jam that we thought he was offering to us because he didn’t mention the opposite and two little drinks of wine that we refused.
The waiter didn’t want to give us the addition and told us “dégage” (get away in french) and “don’t talk with my customers” with a lot of violence then pushed my mother away that wanted to prevent the others."
Heaven's Door,Alexandre Macedo Moscoso,1 star,"The food was expensive but good (grilled octopus). The problem is that they charge you for even more than the expensive stuff you ordered, are harsh and try to turn you down when you try to argue about it and, only after you insist, manually do the calculations and show them it's completely wrong is that they pretend it was a mistake, say sorry, etc.

They also bring even more overly priced stuff you didn't ask for to the table and if you, by mistake, eat it, then you are in a worse scenery.

It's a probably a police issue as most tourists just takes the losses, a few will make it ""right"", but probably none will take the time to place a charge, so the thing keep going."
Heaven's Door,Andreas Madsen,1 star,"SCAM warning.
This place does not provide the correct prices afterwards.
They claim not to have a working recipe machine and yet manage to retrieve it after som discussion.
The service fee was 30 euros, compared to the 90 euros of the whole meal is ridiculous.
They get aggressive when you start to ask about it and try to argue that it is normal.
The food was overall mediocre and does not match the terrible service.
As a note they only take cash."
Heaven's Door,Zoe Leung,1 star,"This restaurant is a scam. We asked for the bill. All of a sudden, their waiter got aggressive and refused to show us the bill. We only ordered around 20 euros food, the bill came back 50 euros with extra charges. It ruined our trip. People aren't honest there BYEE"

Bathroom was simply disgusting

First of all, I don't recommend this restaurant at all, we had sea food paella and grilled  salmon for dinner. The shrimp were not fresh, probably from yesterday.. We asked to change the vegetables with rice as accompaniment for the Salomon, the waiter agreed to that, but when the bill arrived, it was charged extra .. and on top of all of that .. we were charged extra fees for table service that we were not aware of, the waiter didn't mention anything
Anyway.. this was a huge deception for our day in Lisbon, a true scam .. and a huge disgrace.. again I truly don't recommend..

When we wanted to pay Separately  he told us he couldn't do that so a few of us were getting stressed about the way he treated us 1 woman went in and explained it to him we wanted to pay individually he said no again bill total 503 euro was the bill after a few words it got dropped to 403 then 303 lot a scamming going on we taught.  The woman who explained said il pay for the bread cheese he was delighted to hear this wasn't delighted to her response when he asked for 117 euro for bread and cheese 🤣🤣🤣 again the bread got waivered.

The best part was we had activities booked so we needed to leave that restaurant as it was 2 hrs later then they brought pizzas to the girls who ordered them they said we haven't time to eat them as we waited nearly 2hrs couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them say OK and gave it to another table PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM THE SCAM RESTAURANT."

Ordered an off menu item (francesinha) which they charged me €30?! I later learned that you can buy the same francesinha at the Time Out Market for €12. The sandwich was disappointing, beef was REALLY tough and unpalatable. Served with chorizo sausage on the side which was tough, dry and inedible. Avoid this place."

I would recommend this place to eat at downtown Portugal. Even if you dont understand Portuguese they will assist you in understanding the menu. They have all types of drinks that you want. It's a mix of Portuguese and Mexican dishes together. They give even gifts and the restaurant is only 3 months  old!

We ask that we are owed and magically buy some pos from the restaurant next door…
Very bad experience"
Heaven's Door,Carlos Yagüe,1 star,"A woman approaches us fifty meters from her place... she encourages us to accompany her, being very friendly and speaking to me in Spanish, responding to our request, which was simply to drink two white wines. Once inside they serve us two very mediocre sparkling wines, served in the glass, they do not show us the menu or the bottle. When I go to pay the amount is €15, “the most expensive wines I have ever had in my entire life,” I complain and they tell me that that is the price. I am also going to tell the lady who recruited me on the street and she tells me that We are in Lisbon and in Seville the prices are more expensive since speaking in Portuguese and making it seem like he doesn't understand me.
Conclusion: they are hospitality pirates and professional scammers. Don't let yourself fall for this place."
Heaven's Door,Pedro Antonio A.S,1 star,"We decided to go to eat at this rte, so to speak.
It took them a long time to bring us the food, and we saw strange things that didn't fit us.
The burger was delicious, but it was too small, it also comes without fries, and they charge you for the fries separately (€4.90)
The fish was good and seemed fresh.
They didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or anything, so we asked for the bill.
When they bring it to me, they bring it to me on a mobile screen, and they tell me if it's okay, and I see a service charge of €4.50 and they tell me that it's the tip, and I tell them that I'm not going to pay them give nothing as a tip, as they have treated us, and he tells me that it is okay, that he will take it away from me since it is not mandatory to pay it, and I tell him that I am going to pay him with a card, and he tells me that it is not possible, that only in cash ,and that I have an ATM in front of the street, to withdraw money.
I didn't like that treatment at all, since it inspires total distrust in me, and I tip if I want, not obliged and even less forced to put it in my account without prior notice, I attach a photo of the rectified ticket (removing the €5 tip)
The bathrooms were also not clean, and the floor was full of water.

They catch us saying menu at 15th. Dish, dessert, drink and two coffees for the parents because we went there as a family of 5. (2 adults 3 children)

The drinks included in the menu... Drinks arrive very quickly then the dish a little less.

Then we ask for dessert, insisting on the 15th menu because we unfortunately saw the disastrous reviews too late...
No more choice for dessert and there we are only offered the Portuguese flan... But yes why not...
We wait and wait and surprise it arrives... A Flamby 🤣

We saw the waiter run to the right to get it, same for coffee.

A Guignol restaurant...

Two stars for the cuisine, the dish was OK.
Two for the atmosphere, they made us laugh.
Insist on only paying what was announced if you realize it too late...
So as announced I didn't pay more than 15x5 in the end...

Otherwise long live the Policia."

We deserve to be sued. €99 for three plates of rice with beef fillet, three carton orange juices (which claim to be natural, 5.90 each), a glass of bad wine that is already served, 4 cod pasties and a €9 service tax . Almost everything they put on the menu is missing. When you go to pay, they tell you that they do not accept cards. They force you to pay in cash without notifying you beforehand. When you ask for the invoice, they say they don't have paper. Curious how several reviews say the same thing. Will Portugal be short of paper? It's a shame not to have read the reviews before.

They wanted to charge us for the service, but seeing our slight annoyance, not to mention the anger we were feeling, they didn't say it was voluntary.

Heaven's Door,Laura Bisicchia,1 star,Very bad experience. A real theft to cheat tourists. 3.70 euros for a 0.50 liter bottle of water. A tea in a can 4.50 euros. Avoid like the plague. Don't let Happy Hour fool you
Heaven's Door,Emilie Zeng,1 star,"A restaurant to absolutely avoid!!! We agreed to sit at this restaurant because the tout seemed friendly. We order 4 dishes, 2 beers and 2 bottles of water, according to the prices displayed on the menu, the bill should have been €73. Rather nice waiter, moderately good dishes… When we asked to pay, payment only in cash claiming that the machine does not work. We are going to kindly withdraw money and we are told €90 without any receipt.
We will demand and demand an explanation… no explanation!!! I recalculate in front of them with their menu... they agree to give us back 7€, but not the remaining 10€ because they say that having eaten outside costs us 10€!!!!!
We were extremely disappointed by this unacceptable scammer behavior because until then our vacation in Lisbon had been ideal.
The lesson to be learned: always look at reviews before going to a restaurant and never stupidly follow a tout!!!"
Heaven's Door,Cristina C.,1 star,"SCAMMERS!!!! And thieves. I didn't read the previous reviews either. They convince you with a menu that includes all meats and fish, but then at the table the waiter tells you that there are only three meats and three fish (the cheapest, of course). The food with a very average quality. The very dirty bathroom. The last straw: they show you the bill on a tablet, you see that the sum does not add up and they tell you that it includes a table service required by law of €10, and that they cannot charge by card."
Heaven's Door,Heiko B.,1 star,"Caution! Fraud!

We were told that the side dishes were included in the price of the main course! We then charged fries and salad (half a tomato, and a forkful of carrot and onion) for €8!

The starter (rolls, some ham and a little cheese) was charged at €15!

The prices to be paid do not match the prices on the card!

In addition, there is no invoice and only cash payment is accepted!

Caution! Fraud!"
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Amilton Sousa,5 stars,"O restaurante tem um atendimento excelente, pratos bem elaborados, espaço muito aconchegante e a comida é feita por brasileiros. Nos ofereçam uma taça de vinho do Porto enquanto decidíamos os pratos, eles são especializados em comida portuguesa, por isso escolhemos pratos com frutos do mar: como camarão ao alho e óleo, mariscos, a sobremesa (Sericaia) é deliciosa e tipica de Portugal e cai muito bem com uma taça de vinho verde. Valeu a pena a maravilhosa experiência."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Fabian Mancera,2 stars,"Food was OK, nothing outstanding for the prices. It was not possible to pay with card which made it hard for the final bill. Side dishes were charged regardless the fact that we didnt order them and a 10% of the final bill was charged for table seats."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Polyana Sousa,5 stars,"Ambiente aconchegante, atendimento excelente feito por brasileiros rsrs. Nos receberam com um vinho do Porto! Eles são especializados em comida portuguesa então pedimos pratos com frutos do mar: Gamba Aguille (camarão alho e óleo) + Cataplana de Mariscos + sobremesa Sericaia (lembra um curau) + taça de vinho verde. Tudo delicioso e muito delicado."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Lorena Vanderberg,5 stars,Personnel's very friendly atention. Fantastic fresh food.

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Alberto Delacruz,5 stars,"Excellent food and service,  very friendly server, hope to go back."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Collin,1 star,AVOID AT ALL COSTS! This place wrote the book on scams. We were lured in by some guy who offered us a free drink and that's where it all started to go wrong. Our waiter told us about the daily specials (which were not listed or priced on the menu) and did not tell us about any prices on the specials. We ordered a sangria and a beer which were at least twice as expensive as anywhere else we have been. The two person special is a what we ordered and the meat was tasteless and so overpriced it's actually unbelievable. DO NOT EVER GO HERE! We spent 120€ on by far the worst meal we had on our entire trip. Absolute garbage!
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Danny Holness,1 star,"Bad experience 2: I ordered a fish main (bream fillet), with bread and butter, and a glass of red wine. The waiter said the fish comes with potatoes and salad, or fries and salad - I asked for the potatoes. The waiter kept suggesting I have some ham and cheese with the bread. I thought he was being helpful and/or not quite hearing my order correctly, so foolishly wavered on the ham. I received the fries, not the potatoes I ordered, and the bream 'fillet' was tiny with lots of bones. Around this time I overheard two separate tables complaining about additional costs, and taxes included in their bill. When I got my bill the ham cost more than the fish I ordered, there were indeed taxes included that I had not been charged elsewhere, and I was charged separately for the fries I didn't order, and the salad, which I was told came with the fish. I would not have ordered the ham, potato side, and salad had the restaurant been up front about these costs. After expressing my dissatisfaction and refusing to pay the full cost (42 - 43 Euros), the staff eventually said I didn't have to pay the taxes. I said I was only happy to pay 30 Euros, and the staff were increasing aggressive calling me stupid and critiquing my sh***y logic, and general understanding of business, and taxation principles. After repeatedly suggesting they call the police if they have an issue, I had to call for witnesses from the neighbouring restaurant customers, then in full view placed 30 Euros on the table, then walked away, leaving a trail of verbal abuse behind me."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Lisette van den Oever,2 stars,"A nice guy with good English talked to us in the street. He told us about a menu somewhere, but we had had a late lunch and weren't hungry yet. Said we were just looking for a place to drink something. So he said 'Yeah, we have happy hour, come on!' So we followed him. Looked like a nice and normal enough place, yet no happy hour to be seen. They didnot have a sweer cocktail and the first beer was brought in from another restaurant? Beer was almost gone by the time cocktail arrived. By that time I was still positive and optimistic though, nice waiter and they went to the trouble to get me a sweet cocktail. Cocktail arrived and it wasnt the best, but doable, other person had another beer. After that we paid and it costs us €16,50 which is quite expensive here for 2 beer and a cocktail, while being lured in with 'happy hour'. Now reading comments and yes, I feel scammed now."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Andrew Chomos,5 stars,Our dinners were fantastic and the service was outstanding.   We really enjoyed the pleasant and professional service.  With great flair and humor.  The Flame blackened sausage appetizer was worth the trip from the USA.  Will be back next visit!!!
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Philipp W,1 star,"Kind staff, clean cosy place, the food needs lots of improvement (the fish was not tender and greasy,  chicken supreme was dry). We received some tapas as starters, which were billed 12.50 although we did not order. Total bill for 2 persens amounted 46 euros for 2 bottles of water, one chicken supreme, one baccalau, one plate of tapas (3 slices of meat, some chease), bred and butter. Conclusion, the restaurant practice is a tourist trap, I wish them to excel with an improved kitchen in the future. Good luck"
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Lavínia Coxi,2 stars,"Had lunch today. The staff is very nice but food was not great at all. We asked a bitoque... first the meat was 🐷 and not the usual beef and they even asked how well we wanted. Porc should always be well done. There was no rice and the meat was awful. it was very bland and full of vinager. We informed the waitress and she took the meat back to cook a bit more and add some seasoning. Made no change it was still very bad. Just eat my salad and the fries. To top the bill was not cheap. I actually felt robbed. I can honestly say it was the worst dinning experience I ever had in Lisbon. Just gave 2 star for the serving staff. Ironic to eat ""typically Portuguese food"" cooked by not porc eating chefs.... By the way I am Portuguese."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Paul Duignan,1 star,This place is to be avoided unless you like paying a lot of money to be tortured with terrible food and overpriced cheap plonk. Once you are in and have ordered the lovely welcome ends and they try to pile on the extras.  It was hard going to get through the main course which was a tasteless mixed meat dish accompanied by something they called chips. I would have probably been happier if someone mugged me in the street at least I could have reported that to the police
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Louis Challamel,1 star,Lugar  com atendimento ruim. Os garçons são agressivos e não avisam quando algo oferecido é pago. A comida é medíocre e com certeza não vale a media de 13 euros. Vinho muito caro e frutos do mar congelados. não recomendo.
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Hanna Sjostrom,1 star,"Worst restaurant we’ve been to in Lisbon!!  The servers were pushy and rude, the food and drink are double the price as anywhere else we’ve been. The drinks were watery and the food was dry and had no flavour. We had to flag the waiter down to get any service and the machine was broken to pay. Not worth your time or money go somewhere else!!!"
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Lukasz Borek,1 star,"As previous opinions - Just do not eat here. This is a scam working only because location. The food is terrible - we tried calamaries, sardines & steak. All like you would not want to try. Do not accept card - „the machine is broken”."

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Denis Savard,1 star,"We were a party of four, walking on the street, when we were invited to enter this restaurant. Two of us wanted vegetarian food, and one, Piri Piri chicken. The man insisted we would get all we needed in his restaurant. Nothing vegetarian, other than an horrible tomato salad (unripe tomatoes and onions) and french fries was on the menu. No piri piri neither. They said they could make Piri Piri, so we stayed. Well, it took them one hour and a half to get our food. The chicken was ok, but tomatoes and french fries ridiculous. We got a small apologie for the delay, but no reduction on food whatsoever (they offered us a desert, but we wanted out of this place). Really bad experience, that ruined that fine evening."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Jessica Erin Ansaldi Cao,1 star,11 pm they said they can’t cake card because the boss is gone. With no heads up. There is 3 tables totally 16 people and they are point to an atm. They didn’t have most of the menu available. Don’t go here.
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Nacho Carretero Molero,1 star,"Don’t even think about it. The ultimate tourist trap, expensive and with horrible service.

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Sinbad Morehod,1 star,"A barker from the street invited me to the cafe; it was raining and I agreed to come in. The atmosphere and interior are not very good, I stayed because it was raining heavily outside. I looked at the menu, chose a mix of seafood on coals for 40 €. The bill was brought for 72 €, plus they only accept cash for payment, and this is another 10% if you withdraw from an ATM. I have already tried similar seafood mixes in other restaurants in Lisbon, so there is something to compare with. In general, the deception with the bill receipt, and most importantly the kitchen, left a bad impression."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,JC DAVID,1 star,"Beware of scam! Tourist trap. You are charged a service fee not indicated when you arrive (14€). Cuisine worthy of a bad fast food restaurant at an exorbitant price (advertised prices not respected because a supplement is added for the accompaniment of the dish). Unable to pay by credit card. No note, you are presented with a vulgar screenshot on the phone showing you the amount to pay. We bring you cheese and ham for the aperitif without asking you anything and when you add the bill you are told that this was chargeable. This type of establishment and practice should no longer exist. It's a shame. Run away…"
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Mario G. Eichner,1 star,"Tourist trap!!! (Scam, tourist trap) Food is disgusting. The fish was not gutted and was charred on one side. Of course served in such a way that you won't see it until later. When it comes to drinks you are being fooled - a small beer is 0.5 liters and a large one is 1 liter!!! But the cheek is the bill. Service fee that was not on the card. Calculation of bread and a beer cost over 6 euros. Be careful with discussions, the restaurant opposite is one of them and in no time at all there are 6 waiters with big upper arms around you."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Oceralookk Oceralookk,3 stars,"The moment you sit there, you are welcomed like princes...good delicious meal...but the moment you finish eating the staff lose their good humor and urge you to leave....almost yours take the money in your pocket to go faster and good luck.

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Miguel Montes Dorado,2 stars,"If you want to be messed with, come!
The waiter changes us from another place. Food comes from outside. They say Portuguese cuisine, but it's Fast-food.
They tell us that they can't give us a paper bill (without a ticket) and that the card reader doesn't work. We didn't want to argue. SCAMMERS. They have stolen about €30 from the Portuguese treasury."

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Santi Tovar,1 star,"The owner is a scoundrel. He gave us a ration that he passed off as two rations (he charged two, of course). When paying, the guy says that card payment doesn't work and gives you a receipt written on a piece of paper. The quality of the fatal food. An absolute scammer."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Bastian M,1 star,"We were there as a group of 5 people. The wine recommendation was good, the service was friendly and committed. The food was only lukewarm, the paella was cold and the dishes came 5 minutes apart. We had to return two dishes, which was met with understanding. The tomato salad was extremely expensive, but also tiny."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Audrey Pradere,1 star,"Restaurant to avoid absolutely! Beware of touts... The manager certainly speaks several languages but to better scam you. The bread costs €2.50, the garnish with the dish is extra and up to €4.50 for the green salad which is not even seasoned. The extra fries are also not cooked. In short, two dishes without dessert €60. A real scam! This restaurant should not exist."

They deceive you by indicating that the menu costs €15, which includes starters, main, dessert and drinks and yet they charge you whatever they want, arguing that the dishes you have ordered were not part of that menu, when in reality They never inform you of that. A totally disastrous service, we will not come back or recommend it to anyone, not because of the price but because of the deception."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Guido Knop,3 stars,Were approached on the street to eat there. The speech wasn't too intrusive so we responded to it. We had paella and grilled squid. Were served very quickly. We deliberately didn't choose the cheapest one. Taste OK but not outstanding. Portion rather very small.
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,APG,1 star,"Food without more, very little quantity. It took them 1 hour to serve us. They charge each serving of bread at 2.50 euros without having ordered it and the menu costs 15.50 euros and they only put a bad, small salad or soup and a small serving.
Disastrous."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Virginie DE VASCONCELOS,1 star,Forced to put 1 because impossible to put less yet it deserves 0. Too nice tout to be honest. The bill was steep.  They do not tell you that the accompaniments are chargeable.  Even the dessert included in the children's menu had to be paid for. Opaque price. You don't know how much you will pay at the end of the meal. Lamentable
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Matthias H.,5 stars,Super delicious food and very friendly service! Totally recommended!
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Sonja Hermanns,1 star,"A very nice waiter showed us the menu and since that's the case at every restaurant here, we went with this one.
The food is outrageously expensive for the service. The pasta was cold and unseasoned.
The fries were declared as 'French fries'. When we asked the waiter that the fries weren't cooked through, they suddenly became 'homemade potatoes'! A large beer is a stein! Costs 10€! Like everywhere else, an entrée is offered. Since we've been here for a while, we immediately asked how much it costs - €10! No thanks! I can really only advise against eating here. Very expensive. Very bad food.
The bill was €80. There was another wine on it that no one drank. People still laughed and said 'no good, no pay'! We gave them 70€ and the waiter said it would be ok. We walked away and were around the corner and then suddenly two waiters ran after us. Threatened us with the police. Really embarrassing. Never experienced anything so anti-social and abnormal!"
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Vincenzo Smriglio,2 stars,"The food was not as described by the negative reviews. The service was discreet and decent, the price reasonable, but what is absolutely worth mentioning is the lack of a POS which forced us after lunch to go and look for an ATM to be able to pay the bill."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Robert W,1 star,"Were lured into the restaurant by a pushy waiter. We didn't have to pay more than was initially explained to us, but €20 per person was still not justified. Tapas for €12 = cheap ham and hard soft cheese, limp salad for €3.50 consisting of iceberg lettuce and a tomato. Are very dissatisfied."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,philippe vogels,1 star,"Restaurant attracts tourists
Be very careful when canvassing the waiters of this restaurant on the street.
You are lured with supposedly very attractive prices for dishes, so that if you are not happy the boss will not make you pay for the dish. Just bullshit.
The dishes are priced identical to the prices that can be found in Lisbon, on the other hand you are murdered on the price of bread, appetizers that are voluntarily left on the table (refuse them if you do not eat them not) and a bottle of poor quality Vino Verde that they charge you at €28 marked menu on the invoice (a good quality Vino Verde costs €4 per bottle in a Portuguese supermarket).
The waiters do everything not to raise the prices and above all they do not warn you that everything is chargeable.
Not recommended."

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Hans Baumgartner,1 star,The food was not served at the time we agreed upon. A look into the kitchen showed us that the food only started to be prepared half an hour after the order was placed. We had to pay the entire bill and leave without Easen so we could catch the bus. That was !Absocht. Totally negative Lisbon experience.
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,FdA,1 star,"Awful. SCAM. HEIST. They charge excessive prices. €13 for a sad burger with nothing and they charge you for the extra garnish at a golden price, without asking for it. Furthermore, after paying, another waiter comes and demands the money already paid."

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Nuno Mendes,2 stars,"Very limited establishment for the price which is very (very) executive knowing that we are in Portugal even if we are rather well located, the dish is in small quantity and the cook does not know how to properly cook the burger steak (burnt side), on the other hand, a friendly welcome from the waiter who is very friendly and who speaks several languages which is pleasant even if I speak Portuguese."
Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Cedric Midon,1 star,"This restaurant opened my eyes, thanks to it I will never set foot in a place where there is a tout again.

Restaurante Costa Vicentina,Ingrid Neaud,1 star,"THIEVES AND LIARS! A GREAT SCAM
We sensed the scam coming so we didn't get it for much but beware of this restaurant, it's extremely expensive because everything is extra but the waiters don't say it and quickly take the menu out from under your eyes ...

Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Kaisa Pukkala,1 star,Food tasted ok but got food poisoning. Can’t recommend.
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Robin V,1 star,"Péssimo serviço de entregas. Encomendamos perto das 10h pela uber, no entanto a entrega é feita pelo restaurante. Meteram em entrega e nunca vieram. Tentamos ligar e nunca atenderam o telefone. Chega ás 11h e a loja aparentemente está fechada e a culpa é do cliente por ""nao ver as horas"".

Sempre adorei o Joshua's mas nos ultimos anos a experiencia tem vindo a piorar. Nao é mais uma opção."
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Joel Rendall,2 stars,"A senhora que me atendeu foi bastante malcriada. Olhou para mim com uma atitude como se já devesse ser perito no menu deles, com perguntas e respostas muito abruptas. Se calhar estava a ter um mau dia, espero que esteja tudo bem. A comida estava aceitável"
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Carlos Dinis,1 star,"Muito, muito, muito mau! Eu atrevo me a dizer que nunca comi tão mal, pra já pedi sem alface, tiraram o tomate e deixaram a alface e depois o frango não tinha sabor absolutamente nenhum e achei muito pouco em termos de porção nunca daria mais do que 4€ pela porção."
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Nicola M,1 star,"Big Wrap apenas de salada. Carne nem vê-la. O vosso serviço nunca foi bom, mas cada vez surpreende mais. Foi a ultima vez."
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Leonor Lopes,2 stars,"Caro, falta de simpatia e falta de conhecimento sobre os produtos ( o que é inadmissível).

Sou vegan e não ingiro gluten. Como tal, perguntei se tinham algum prato que se adaptasse a essas condições e disseram que não. Depois de observar o menu com atenção reparei que (obviamente) tinham. Quando me tiraram as batatas (que já estavam lá há algum tempo), pedi para fritarem outras na hora porque gosto delas bem quentinhas. Reclamaram que tinham sido acabadas de fritar, mas lá fizeram o favor.

No final de tudo as batatas tinham realmente um sabor diferente do habitual, no entanto não desgostei. A comida é boa, o atendimento péssimo. Parecia que estavam a fazer um frete enorme cada vez que se perguntava algo. Mudem a equipa para pessoal mais competente por favor"
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,João Garcia,1 star,"Terrível. A senhora é malcriada e faz muito mau atendimento. Sempre a resmungar com o telefone com os pedidos, etc.. A comida por 11 euros mal servida e com péssima qualidade."
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Maria Figueiredo,1 star,"A parvalhona de farda branca de cabelo preto que está a atender devia se acalmar um pouco e aprender a respeitar os seus colegas, para alem de tar a tratar a sua colega que claramente estava a aprender que nem burra, ainda diz coisas para ela tipo: já me estás a irritar?

Que isso????  A rapariga claramente com dúvidas e nervosa e esta anormal que não tem outro nome a tratá-la mal!"
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Alesandra Nunes,2 stars,"Fizemos pedido pelo UberEats, as batatas fritas  parece que foi feito no dia anterior, o Kebab era tudo menos Kebab, e o shoarma a carne parece que foi feita sem tempero algum, parece que foi cortada e frita.
A coca-cola estava boa ;)

Não indico!"
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Anastasia Hlebka,1 star,Awful food. I never eat before such a disgusting dish. Dry falafel and rice. Portion is soo small. My fault is I did not read a review. all true what people said here. Never again
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Daniel Peixoto Martins,1 star,"Péssimo.
Pouca carne e de origem duvidosa.
Não é servido nem borrego nem vaca mas sim uns hambúrgueres minúsculo feito da carne destes animais e sem que se perceba a diferença entre uma carne e outra.
Preço elevado.
De positivo, o atendimento foi simpático e educado.
A evitar mesmo"
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Thomas Maas,1 star,"Caro! Encomendei o menu grande e era pouco para ser pequeno. Pagei €12,50 pelo menu quando nunca daria mais que 6 euros pelo que recebi. A unica coisa grande neste menu, é que era uma grande mentira. Nunca mais."
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Noy Kanovich,1 star,One of the worst shawarma’s I ate in a long time. Almost 10€ for dry shawarma with no sauce and without asking what we want inside. Definitely do not recommend this place.
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,António Nunes,1 star,"Fiz uma encomenda no ubereats... 3 menus... Entregaram 1, as batatas fritas sabiam mal e a comida vinha fria.

Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Pedro V,5 stars,"O atendimento foi excelente. A empregada de hoje sabe explicar todos os pratos muito bem e é muito simpática e eficiente com os clientes. Noutros restaurantes não é costume o serviço ser tão bom.

Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Sofia Lourenço,1 star,"Comida péssima, wrap pequeníssimo só massa e pouca carne seca , quebab a mesma coisa, o bitoque só tinha era arroz, a carne quase que não existia. Até o molho não era bom."

Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Ewald Jerger,1 star,Absolutely disgusting
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Mani,1 star,"Two pita menus and an OVERpriced salad for what it was. 43€ for two dry breads, empty pita, 3 leaves of salad which are chasing each other and a few pieces of chicken with a seasoning with a taste that I cannot explain because it was so inedible that even when trying to fill the void it was in the pita with the fries and the sauce that came alongside the taste took over. The “Greek” salad was not a Greek salad, the salad was very soft and no seasoning. Big scam, don't refer to the photos of the menus that may appear on Uber (I ordered it above), it has nothing to do with reality. Don't even try. Run away. It's not worth any stars, I had to put one because I have to publish a review."
Joshua's Shoarma Grill,Samuel Schön,2 stars,"Lackluster service and subpar food lead to this two-star rating.
The salad didn't seem fresh and I'm still wondering if the meat was real or just a substitute product thrown together."
